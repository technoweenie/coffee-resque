# Coffee-Resque

Coffeescript/Node.js port of Resque.

## USAGE

First, you'll want to queue some jobs in your app:

```javascript
var resque = require('coffee-resque').connect({
  host: redisHost,
  port: redisPort
});
resque.enqueue('math', 'add', [1,2]);
```

Next, you'll want to setup a worker to handle these jobs.   

Upon completion of the job, invoke the passed callback with a result 
(if a result was produced by the job) or an `Error` (if an error was
encountered).  If an `Error` is received, resque fails the
job. In all other cases resque assumes the job is successful.

The callback is importantâ€”it notifies resque that the worker
has completed the current job and is ready for another. Neglecting to 
invoke the callback will result in worker starvation.

```javascript
// implement your job functions.
var myJobs = {
  add: function(a, b, callback) { callback(a + b); },
  succeed: function(arg, callback) { callback(); },
  fail: function(arg, callback) { callback(new Error('fail')); }
}

// setup a worker
var worker = require('coffee-resque').connect({
  host: redisHost,
  port: redisPort
}).worker('*', myJobs)

// some global event listeners
//
// Triggered every time the Worker polls.
worker.on('poll', function(worker, queue) {})

// Triggered before a Job is attempted.
worker.on('job', function(worker, queue, job) {})

// Triggered every time a Job errors.
worker.on('error', function(err, worker, queue, job) {})

// Triggered on every successful Job run.
worker.on('success', function(worker, queue, job, result) {})

worker.start()
```

## Worker Polling Mechanism

As of v0.1.9, workers poll the given queues similar to [Ruby Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque):

```
start
loop do
  if job = reserve
    job.process
  else
    sleep 5 # Polling frequency = 5
  end
end
shutdown
```

This ensures that multiple queues are polled in the priority mentioned.  Eg: If a worker is started on "queue1,queue2",
queue1 is drained completely before jobs in queue2 are processed.

Prior to v0.1.9, workers used to poll the queues in a round-robin fashion.

## Development

All code is written in Coffee Script and converted to javascript as it's
published to npm.

For normal development, all you need to be concerned about is testing:

```bash
$ make test
```

If you need to generate javascript for production purposes and don't want to use npm packages, you can use:

```bash
$ make generate-js
$ make remove-js
```

You can also have coffeescript watch the `src` directory and generate Javascript files as they're updated.

```bash
$ make dev
```

## TODO

* Generic failure handling
* Better polling
